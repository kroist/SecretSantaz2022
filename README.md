# Secret Santaz 2022 ed.

### About
Telegram chat bot, which allows to participate in a Secret Santa event.

Also there is a maze minigame, where user controls elf in 20x20 maze.

The goal of the project was to test **ChatGPT** code writing skills. Yet there are some code corrections done by me. Almost all the code was written only by **ChatGPT**, which was prompted with questions like:

- *write me a telegram bot which acts like a secret santa. Users can register and admin makes a present assignment*
- *we need to use a derangement permuation to assign secret santas for participants*
- *Write me a telegram bot where I can play in 2d maze. After each move I can see only 7x7 part of maze around me. Maze consists of walls, air and player. Depict them as emojis*

### Commands

- `/register` - register in Secret Santaz 2022 event
- `/assign` - admin command, use it to assign secret santa for each participant
- `/maze` - play the maze
